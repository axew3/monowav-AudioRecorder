# Audio Recorder

This is a code snippet/example for using RecorderJS with the web audio input feature to record audio from
[Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html).  
- MONO wav -
This is just an "on fly" example/snippet by [axew3](https://www.axew3.com/w3/). A modified version of the [AudioRecorder](https://github.com/cwilso/AudioRecorder) wav encoder, that convert to MONO wav (not stereo, so it is suitable to be used for google speech API, for example) and save on disk the wav file as basic example.
Improve initAudio function on main.js for a more recent javascript code.
